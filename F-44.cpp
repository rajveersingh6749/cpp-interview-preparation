5. Overloading << and >> operators (for I/O)

To use cout << obj; and cin >> obj;, we cannot make them member functions because the left operand (cout / cin) is not an object of your class.
So, they must be friend functions.

/*
ðŸ§© Tip:
For chaining like cout << a << b;, you must return the stream reference.
