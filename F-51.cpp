5. What is the Standard Template Library (STL)?

✅ Definition:
The STL is a collection of generic C++ classes and functions that provide ready-to-use data structures and algorithms.

It has four main components:

    -Algorithms → sort, find, count, reverse, etc.

    -Containers → vector, list, map, set, etc.

    -Iterators → to traverse containers.

    -Functors → function objects used with algorithms.
